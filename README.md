#### MacOS Database
Let us setup our database:

  ```sql
  drop database academicstoday_db;
  create database academicstoday_db;
  \c academicstoday_db;
  CREATE USER django WITH PASSWORD '123password';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE academicstoday_db to django;
  ALTER USER django CREATEDB;
  ALTER ROLE django SUPERUSER;
  -- CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
  ```

#### Ubuntu Database
Let us setup our database:

  ```sql
  sudo -i -u postgres
  psql

  DROP DATABASE academicstoday_db;
  CREATE DATABASE academicstoday_db;
  \c academicstoday_db;
  CREATE USER django WITH PASSWORD '123password';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE academicstoday_db to django;
  ALTER USER django CREATEDB;
  -- ALTER ROLE django SUPERUSER;
  -- CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
  ```

#### CentOS 7 Database:

  ```sql
  sudo -i -u postgres;
  dropdb academicstoday_db;
  createdb academicstoday_db;
  psql academicstoday_db;
  CREATE USER django WITH PASSWORD '123password';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE academicstoday_db to django;
  ALTER USER django CREATEDB;
  ALTER ROLE django SUPERUSER;
  -- CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
  ```

### Application + Database
Run the following command to create your custom settings instance. Note: Please write all your application passwords here as it won't be tracked on git.

  ```

Run the following commands to populate the database.
  ```
  cd ../academicstoday;
  python manage.py makemigrations;
  python manage.py migrate_schemas;
  python manage.py populate_public;
  python manage.py setup_fixtures;
  python manage.py populate_site;
  ```

Update your hosts file to support our applications domain.
